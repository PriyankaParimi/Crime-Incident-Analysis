# Semantic-Web-Project
<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p> We have started our project by analyzing and reviewing various datasets. Then we finalized on two datasets: “Seattle Police Department 911 Incident Response” and “Seattle Police Department Police Report Incident” from data.gov website. These two datasets have been downloaded (i.e rdf files) and uploaded into Gruff to understand the semantics of these datasets. Then we started looking into integration of these datasets by extracting the attributes for each of the dataset. We then decide to integrate on “Incident type” to provide better analysis on how many incidents are reported and responded.  </p>
<p>The finalized datasets (i.e rdf files) have been uploaded into Apache Jena FUSEKI server and SPARQL queries are executed to extract the desired information. The output of these queries is in JSON format which is fed into Google Visualization API. Google Visualization API provides better visualization results. Final web page has been developed using HTML,Bootstrap, Javascript and Google visualization packages Bar, Map, Corechart, Piechart and SteppedAreaChart. </p>
